# Post-Migration Actions

## Monitoring

- Ensure analytics (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Google Analytics) and error tracking (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) are enabled and reporting correctly after migration.
- Regularly review logs and performance metrics for regressions or issues.

## User Feedback

- Provide a feedback form or contact link on the site for users to report issues.
- Monitor GitHub Issues and email for bug reports or suggestions.

## Documentation Updates

- Update all onboarding and developer documentation to reflect the move to Tailwind CSS and the removal of Sass/SCSS.
- Remove references to Sass/SCSS from README, code comments, and docs.
- Document any new Tailwind or shadcn/ui conventions, utility classes, and component usage.
- Add migration notes for any replaced or refactored styles/components.

## Lessons Learned

- Moving away from Sass/SCSS to TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui has reduced style conflicts and improved development speed.
- Tailwind's utility-first approach and shadcn/ui's component library are now the standard for all new styling and UI work.
