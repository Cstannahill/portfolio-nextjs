# üõ†Ô∏è Migration Plan: Personal Developer Portfolio


## 1. üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive migration plan for the Personal Developer Portfolio (https://cstannahill-software-dev.vercel.app/). This site is intended to be shown to potential or prospective employers, so every migration and new feature should reflect a high standard of engineering, design, and user experience. The goal is to ensure a seamless, well-documented transition to the new platform, codebase, or infrastructure, while preserving all critical features, content, and SEO value. The plan is modeled after the documentation standards in [portfolio-manager/docs](https://github.com/Cstannahill/portfolio-manager/tree/main/docs).

**Key Emphasis:**

- All additions and improvements should be visually impressive, cleanly styled, and demonstrate best practices in modern frontend development.
- Features and UI/UX should highlight your strengths as a developer, including accessibility, performance, and thoughtful design.
- The site should serve as a living portfolio, easy to update and extend, and a showcase of your technical and product thinking.

## 2. üéØ Migration Goals

- **Preserve all content** (projects, blog posts, about, readme, etc.) and ensure no data loss.
- **Maintain or improve SEO** (URLs, metadata, sitemap, robots.txt, OG images).
- **Retain all core features** (multilingual support, dynamic routing, MDX content, design system).
- **Ensure full functionality** (API integrations, route guards, smooth navigation, etc.).
- **Modernize or refactor** code where needed for maintainability and scalability.
- **Document all changes** and provide clear migration steps for future reference.

## 4. üõ§Ô∏è Migration Steps

### 4.1. Preparation

- [ ] Review and lock current production deployment.
- [ ] Backup all MDX content, images, and configuration files.
- [ ] Audit all environment variables and API keys (Mailchimp, etc.).
- [ ] List all custom components and utilities (see `/components`, `/lib`, `/once-ui`).

### 4.2. Content Migration

- [ ] Export all MDX files from `/content/blog`, `/content/projects`, `/content/work`.
- [ ] Export all images from `/public/images` and `/assets/images`.
- [ ] Export localization files from `/messages` and `/src/app/resources`.
- [ ] Document any hardcoded content in config files (`config.js`, `content.js`).

### 4.3. Feature & Routing Migration

- [ ] Map all routes from the live site to the new structure.
- [ ] Ensure dynamic routing for projects and blog posts is preserved.
- [ ] Migrate or refactor route guards and hash scrolling logic.
- [ ] Validate middleware for locale handling and redirects.

### 4.4. Design System & Styling

- [ ] Export Once UI components and custom SCSS modules.
- [ ] Audit and migrate theme tokens, variables, and global styles.
- [ ] Remove deprecated or unused components/styles.

### 4.5. API & Integration Migration

- [ ] Migrate Mailchimp integration and test subscription flow.
- [ ] Migrate any other API routes (e.g., `/api/authenticate`).
- [ ] Validate all environment variables in the new environment.

### 4.6. SEO & Metadata

- [ ] Export and validate `next-sitemap.config.js`, `robots.txt`, and OG images.
- [ ] Ensure all pages have correct metadata, titles, and descriptions.
- [ ] Test sitemap generation and robots.txt accessibility.

### 4.7. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Set up local environment and run all tests (unit, integration, E2E if available).
- [ ] Manually test all routes, features, and integrations.
- [ ] Validate responsive design and accessibility.
- [ ] Check for broken links, missing images, and localization issues.

### 4.8. Deployment

- [ ] Set up new deployment environment (Vercel or alternative).
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets.
- [ ] Deploy to staging and run smoke tests.
- [ ] Deploy to production and monitor logs.

### 4.9. Post-Migration

- [ ] Monitor analytics and error tracking.
- [ ] Solicit user feedback and address any issues.
- [ ] Update documentation and onboarding guides.

## 5. üìù Documentation Standards

- All migration steps, decisions, and issues should be documented in `/docs/migration/` (or equivalent).
- Use the [portfolio-manager/docs](https://github.com/Cstannahill/portfolio-manager/tree/main/docs) structure:
  - `migration-overview.md`
  - `content-mapping.md`
  - `feature-parity-checklist.md`
  - `deployment-notes.md`
  - `post-migration-actions.md`
- Include screenshots, code snippets, and before/after comparisons where helpful.

## 6. üìë Example Documentation Structure

```
/docs/migration/
  migration-overview.md
  content-mapping.md
  feature-parity-checklist.md
  deployment-notes.md
  post-migration-actions.md
```

- **migration-overview.md**: Executive summary, goals, and high-level steps.
- **content-mapping.md**: Table mapping old URLs/content to new locations.
- **feature-parity-checklist.md**: List of all features with migration status.
- **deployment-notes.md**: Environment setup, deployment steps, and troubleshooting.
- **post-migration-actions.md**: Monitoring, analytics, and user feedback.

## 8. ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Create `/docs/migration/` directory and initial documentation files.**
2. **Begin content and feature inventory.**
3. **Schedule migration window and communicate with stakeholders.**
4. **Follow the migration steps above, documenting each phase.**
5. **Review, test, and deploy.**

**Remember:**

- Every migration and new feature is an opportunity to impress future employers and collaborators.
- Prioritize polish, clarity, and maintainability in all code and UI decisions.
- Use this documentation as a living reference for both migration and ongoing portfolio evolution.

If you would like, I can scaffold the `/docs/migration/` directory and create the initial Markdown files with templates for you. Let me know if you want to proceed with that or need any section expanded in more detail!
