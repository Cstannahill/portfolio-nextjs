## Debugging & Problem-Solving Approach

<FeatureList
  title="Error Diagnosis Techniques"
  items={[
    "Diagnose errors (e.g., Prisma schema validation, Next.js routing issues, Lua script errors, Unity exceptions)",
    "Get explanations of stack traces, often following up with clarifying questions",
    "Request refactors based on updated architecture or UI/UX changes",
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Developer Maturity" icon="🔍">
  Your approach isn't to blindly ask "Why doesn't this work?" — you usually
  describe the error, what you've tried, and what your expected outcome is,
  which shows high developer maturity.
</Callout>

## Strategic Planning & Architecture

<FeatureList
  title="Architectural Collaboration"
  items={[
    'Choosing frameworks and languages for new projects (e.g., "Which stack is better for this use case?")',
    "Structuring modular, scalable file systems and codebases (especially in Next.js, Prisma, and Redux Toolkit)",
    "Evaluating trade-offs between technologies like Realtime DB vs Firestore, NextAuth vs custom auth, or Ollama vs OpenAI-hosted LLMs",
  ]}
/>

## Learning & Knowledge Acquisition

<FeatureList
  title="Learning Strategies"
  items={[
    "Ask layered follow-ups until you fully grasp a concept",
    "Challenge responses when something feels off or unclear",
    'Request comparative explanations across familiar technologies ("...explain it again compared to how it works in C#/JavaScript?")',
  ]}
/>

## Feature & UI Development

<FeatureList
  title="UI/UX Design Collaboration"
  items={[
    "Brainstorm components, design responsive layouts, and scaffold reusable elements",
    "Balance aesthetics and functionality with modern styling techniques",
    "Explore full-stack implementation from model → API → UI → interactivity",
  ]}
/>

## Advanced Technology Exploration

<FeatureList
  title="Research Partnership Domains"
  items={[
    "Hosting and tuning local AI models like Mistral, CapybaraHermes, Flux.1, or LLaMA",
    "Building a blockchain for decentralized AI models with a PoS consensus mechanism",
    "Designing a Unity 2D platformer with C# for kids",
    "Making an IoT water leak sensor system with phone alerts",
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="success" title="Exploration Approach" icon="💡">
  You don't just ask "How do I do this?" — you break it down, ask if it's a good
  idea, then customize or challenge the approach.
</Callout>

## Code Quality & Automation

<FeatureList
  title="Code Quality Focus"
  items={[
    "Generate utility functions, normalize schemas, or group/filter datasets logically",
    'Request codebase reorganizations like "Move assistant logic to lib/assistant/utils"',
    'Enforce or verify best practices — not just "get it working," but "get it right"',
  ]}
/>

        "You adopt new tools when they make sense, but question appropriateness first",
    },
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="success" title="Summary" icon="📈">
  You're using AI like a senior dev uses a strong junior — bounce ideas off it,
  have it do grunt work, double-check things, catch edge cases, generate drafts,
  and brainstorm fast. And the fact you're constantly refining things? That's
  the mark of someone leveling up, not just leaning on AI.
