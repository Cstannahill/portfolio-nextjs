## 🧠 Overview

**Tree Me** is a minimal, TypeScript-powered CLI tool for recursively walking directory trees, generating relative file paths, and building sharable GitHub-style links for every file. It's ideal for documenting, linking, or sharing the structure of your projects, and supports output in .txt, Markdown, or JSON formats. Tree Me is npm-publishing ready and designed for automation or integration into docs.
