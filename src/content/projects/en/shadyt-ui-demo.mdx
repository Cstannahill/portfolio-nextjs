## 🧠 Overview

**Shadyt UI Demo** showcases a modular, expressive React component library built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Inspired by MongoDB's paper-rich visual style, it provides developers with a vibrant, production-ready set of UI blocks, layout helpers, and animation utilities. The demo app serves as both a documentation site and a playground for the library's 50+ components.
