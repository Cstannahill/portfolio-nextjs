## 🧠 Overview

**Image Transformation API** is a modern .NET 8 Web API for real-time image processing and CDN delivery. It enables developers to resize, crop, convert, filter, and watermark images via simple HTTP endpoints. Designed for performance and scalability, it features built-in rate limiting, API key quotas, logging, and Prometheus metrics. The API is easily self-hosted (Docker, Azure Functions, Kubernetes) and is ideal for web apps, SaaS, or any service needing dynamic image handling.
