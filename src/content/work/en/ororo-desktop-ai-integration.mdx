## üß† Overview

**Ororo Desktop AI Integration** is an Electron-based desktop application designed to function as an AI-powered pair programmer and coding assistant. Its core goal is to overcome the context limitations of standard LLMs by providing the AI with persistent memory and direct access to local project files and structures. Ororo assists users with planning, designing, coding, debugging, and documenting software projects through an interactive chat interface.

The assistant leverages local storage for project structures and user preferences/memories, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and specific filesystem tools to provide contextually relevant and actionable help.

  This desktop application combines Electron's cross-platform capabilities with
  React's UI framework and TypeScript's type safety, using SQLite for local data
  persistence and the OpenAI API for AI capabilities.
