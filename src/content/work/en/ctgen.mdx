## 🧠 Overview

**CTGen** is a developer productivity tool that automates the scaffolding of modern web and API projects. Supporting both Next.js (TypeScript) and .NET (C#), it generates directory structures, boilerplate code, configuration files, and even Docker/CI setups. CTGen is designed to help developers start new projects quickly, with best practices and sensible defaults out of the box.
