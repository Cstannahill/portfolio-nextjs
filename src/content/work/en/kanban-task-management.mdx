## Overview

This **Application Tracking and Kanban Board** project is a personal tool designed to manage job applications while incorporating a collaborative task management system. Built with ReactJS and Firebase, the project features a Kanban board for visualizing tasks and application stages, offering an intuitive way to track progress. The project also served as a learning opportunity to adapt a large, pre-built theme by stripping unnecessary features and understanding its structure without documentation, allowing for significant customization and optimization.
