## 🧠 Overview

**Project Flow** is a full-featured, developer-first planning tool that bridges the gap between whiteboarding and implementation. Designed to help solo devs and teams visually map, organize, and architect software projects from idea to deployment.

Whether you're tracking frontend features, defining API endpoints, structuring databases, or visualizing system architecture with diagrams—Project Flow offers a unified interface for clear thinking and structured execution.
