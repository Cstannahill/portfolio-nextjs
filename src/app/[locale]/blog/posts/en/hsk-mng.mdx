## Key Features

- **Real-Time Task Tracking**: Leveraged Firebase's Realtime Database to synchronize housekeeping statuses, enabling instant visibility into completed and pending tasks across all apartments.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented secure authentication and authorization with Firebase, ensuring staff and management have appropriate access to data and functionality.
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Built an intuitive ReactJS dashboard to display cleaning schedules, notes, and task details in a user-friendly format.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: Allowed staff to update statuses, add task notes, and manage cleaning priorities seamlessly in real-time.
- **Backend Integration**: Developed APIs using Node.js and Next.js to support efficient data retrieval and updates.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For creating a dynamic and responsive front-end interface.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for authentication, Realtime Database, and Firestore to handle data synchronization and storage.
- **Node.js and Next.js**: For building the backend API and server-side functionality.
- **CSS and Tailwind**: For a clean, professional design and user experience.
- **Vercel Hosting**: Deployed the application for scalability and reliability in the cloud.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensuring real-time synchronization between multiple users while maintaining data integrity and avoiding conflicts. Firebase Realtime Database provided a robust solution but required careful structuring of data to optimize performance. Additionally, designing an intuitive user interface that accommodated both staff and management workflows highlighted the importance of user-centric design principles. I was also not as familiar with NoSQL as I was with other forms such as SSMS/T-SQL.

## Outcome

The application streamlined housekeeping operations by providing a transparent and collaborative platform for tracking and managing tasks. Real-time updates reduced miscommunications and redundancies, leading to improved operational efficiency. The scalable architecture ensures the application can be extended to other operational use cases in the future.
