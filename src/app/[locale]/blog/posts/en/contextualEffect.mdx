The following is an analysis generated by ChatGPT after early exploration with contextual injection. <br /> <br />
I had walked through my early developmental journey, step by step walking through each file of code I worked on throughout
my first two projects, and how I had learned to think about the code I was writing.
<br /> <br />
I gave as much context as I could about the projects I worked on, the decisions I made, and the
technical challenges I faced. I also provided a lot of context about the
technical stack I was using, the languages I was working with, and the
frameworks I was using. This was a manual process of injecting context into the AI, and it was a very interesting experience.
<br /> <br />
I asked ChatGPT to then analyze what it had learned about me, my
development experience, and how that context would affect the way I
learn, code, and collaborate with AI to grow even faster. The following is the
result of that analysis..
