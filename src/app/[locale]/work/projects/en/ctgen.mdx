## üß† Overview

**CTGen** is a developer productivity tool that automates the scaffolding of modern web and API projects. Supporting both Next.js (TypeScript) and .NET (C#), it generates directory structures, boilerplate code, configuration files, and even Docker/CI setups. CTGen is designed to help developers start new projects quickly, with best practices and sensible defaults out of the box.

---

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

- **Next.js & .NET Support**: Scaffold full-featured Next.js (TypeScript) or .NET (C#) projects with a single command.
- **App Directory Structure**: Generates organized folders (app/, components/, lib/, etc.) and config files.
- **Database Setup**: Optionally includes Postgres setup and .env configuration.
- **API Boilerplate**: For .NET, creates layered solution structure (Controllers, Models, Services, Data, etc.), enums, response classes, and sample controllers.
- **Testing & CI**: Adds sample unit tests and GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
- **Docker Support**: Generates Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for API + Postgres orchestration.
- **Customizable**: Interactive mode for tailored scaffolding, or use --all for defaults.

---

## üß± Architecture & Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript (CLI), C# (for .NET scaffolding)
- **Platforms**: Node.js (npm global install), .NET
- **Structure**:
  - `src/` ‚Äì CLI logic and templates
  - `scripts/` ‚Äì Release and helper scripts
  - `.github/workflows/` ‚Äì Generated CI/CD workflows
- **License**: MIT

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Philosophy

- **Speed & Consistency**: Eliminate repetitive setup and ensure best practices from the start.
- **Cross-Platform**: Support both modern web (Next.js) and backend/API (.NET) stacks.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new templates, features, or project types.
- **Developer Experience**: Interactive prompts or one-liner commands for fast onboarding.

## üìà Development Highlights

- ‚úÖ One-command project scaffolding for Next.js and .NET
- ‚úÖ Layered .NET solution structure with sample controllers and tests
- ‚úÖ Docker and CI/CD setup out of the box
- ‚úÖ Customizable via CLI options and interactive mode

---

## üöß WIP + Future Roadmap

- Add more project templates (NestJS, React Native, etc.)
- Extend database and cloud integration options
- Improve template customization and user prompts
- Add more language/framework support
- Enhance documentation and usage guides

---

## üîó Summary

CTGen accelerates the start of new projects by automating the boring parts‚Äîdirectory setup, boilerplate, config, and CI. It‚Äôs ideal for developers who want to focus on building, not setup, and ensures every project starts with a solid foundation.
