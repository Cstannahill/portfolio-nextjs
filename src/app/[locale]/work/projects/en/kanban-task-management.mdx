## Overview

This **Application Tracking and Kanban Board** project is a personal tool designed to manage job applications while incorporating a collaborative task management system. Built with ReactJS and Firebase, the project features a Kanban board for visualizing tasks and application stages, offering an intuitive way to track progress. The project also served as a learning opportunity to adapt a large, pre-built theme by stripping unnecessary features and understanding its structure without documentation, allowing for significant customization and optimization.

## Key Features

- **Kanban Board**: Implemented a drag-and-drop interface for task management, enabling users to organize tasks or applications across different stages visually.
- **Application Tracker**: Designed a system to track job applications, including company details, application status, and follow-up dates.
- **Custom Theme Optimization**: Refactored a pre-built theme to remove unused components and features, streamlining the codebase for the projectâ€™s specific needs.
- **Data Persistence**: Integrated Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval, ensuring user data is always accessible and up-to-date.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the interface is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the front-end application with dynamic components and state management.
- **SQL Server**: For storing data such as user information, task boards, and tasks.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for consistent, modern UI design and styling.
- **.NET**: Backend API support for extending the functionality.
- **Azure**: Used to host the application, as well as for the SQL Server.

## Challenges and Learnings

Adapting a large, pre-built theme without documentation posed an initial challenge, requiring significant effort to analyze the structure and functionality. Identifying and removing unused components was key to improving performance and maintainability. Additionally, integrating Firebase for real-time updates presented opportunities to refine database structuring and optimize synchronization.

## Outcome

This project successfully delivered a functional and visually appealing tool for managing job applications and tasks. The combination of the Kanban board and tracking system provided an efficient workflow for users, while the customization process showcased problem-solving and adaptability. This project remains a valuable learning experience in theme optimization, React development, and real-time data handling.
