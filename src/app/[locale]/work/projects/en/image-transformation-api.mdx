## üß† Overview

**Image Transformation API** is a modern .NET 8 Web API for real-time image processing and CDN delivery. It enables developers to resize, crop, convert, filter, and watermark images via simple HTTP endpoints. Designed for performance and scalability, it features built-in rate limiting, API key quotas, logging, and Prometheus metrics. The API is easily self-hosted (Docker, Azure Functions, Kubernetes) and is ideal for web apps, SaaS, or any service needing dynamic image handling.

---

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

- **Image Operations**: Resize, crop (rectangle/rounded), convert formats, apply filters (grayscale, invert, blur), and add watermarks.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Interactive docs and client generation for C#, TypeScript, and more.
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure endpoints with per-key rate limiting and daily quotas.
- **Metrics & Logging**: Serilog for structured logs, Prometheus for HTTP metrics, and health check endpoints.
- **Docker-Ready**: Optimized Dockerfile for Alpine-based .NET runtime and native dependencies.
- **Serverless & Cloud-Ready**: Deployable to Azure Functions, Kubernetes, or any container platform.

---

## üß± Architecture & Stack

- **Framework**: .NET 8 (Minimal APIs)
- **Language**: C# (with TypeScript SDK generation)
- **Containerization**: Docker (Alpine-based)
- **Metrics**: Prometheus
- **Logging**: Serilog
- **Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for Azure Container Registry

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Philosophy

- **Performance-First**: Minimal API surface, async processing, and optimized for cloud/container environments.
- **Security**: API key authentication, quotas, and rate limiting out of the box.
- **Developer Experience**: Interactive Swagger docs, SDK generation, and clear error handling.
- **Extensibility**: Modular endpoints and easy to add new filters or operations.

## üìà Development Highlights

- ‚úÖ Minimal .NET 8 implementation with top-level statements
- ‚úÖ Full suite of image operations (resize, crop, convert, filter, watermark)
- ‚úÖ API key management and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics and Serilog logging
- ‚úÖ Docker and Azure Functions deployment
- ‚úÖ OpenAPI/Swagger for docs and SDKs

---

## üöß WIP + Future Roadmap

- Add more image filters (sharpen, brightness, contrast)
- AI-powered enhancements (upscaling, style transfer)
- CDN integration (Azure CDN, Cloudflare)
- Serverless deployment optimizations
- Enhanced client SDKs and usage examples

---

## üîó Summary

Image Transformation API is a robust, production-ready solution for dynamic image processing in modern web and cloud applications. With a focus on performance, security, and developer experience, it‚Äôs ideal for any project needing scalable, real-time image manipulation.
