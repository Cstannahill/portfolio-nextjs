## 🧠 Overview

**Tree Me** is a minimal, TypeScript-powered CLI tool for recursively walking directory trees, generating relative file paths, and building sharable GitHub-style links for every file. It’s ideal for documenting, linking, or sharing the structure of your projects, and supports output in .txt, Markdown, or JSON formats. Tree Me is npm-publishing ready and designed for automation or integration into docs.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **Recursive Directory Walk**: Traverses entire folder trees and outputs structure.
- **GitHub-Style Links**: Generates clickable URLs for each file, using a base Git remote or custom URL.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports .txt, Markdown, and JSON outputs.
- **Pretty-Printed Tree View**: Optional visual tree structure for easy reading.
- **CLI Options**: Depth limiting, output file, base URL override, and more.
- **Auto-Detects Git Remote**: Infers GitHub-compatible links if no base URL is provided.

---

## 🧱 Architecture & Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Distribution**: npm global CLI
- **Structure**:
  - `src/` – CLI logic and utilities
  - `dist/` – Compiled JS output
  - `package.json` – CLI entry and metadata
- **License**: MIT

---

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies, fast execution, and easy to use.
- **Automation-Ready**: Designed for scripting, CI, and documentation workflows.
- **Sharable**: Makes it easy to share project structure with clickable links.

## 📈 Development Highlights

- ✅ Recursive directory traversal
- ✅ GitHub-style link generation
- ✅ Multiple output formats (txt, md, json)
- ✅ Pretty-printed tree view
- ✅ CLI options for depth, output, and base URL

---

## 🚧 WIP + Future Roadmap

- Toggle between GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket link templates
- Include folders as clickable links
- Export as markdown with tree + links
- VSCode extension or GUI launcher
- Interactive prompt for missing args

---

## 🔗 Summary

Tree Me is a fast, flexible CLI for visualizing and sharing your project’s structure. It’s perfect for open source maintainers, technical writers, and anyone who wants to make their codebase more accessible.
