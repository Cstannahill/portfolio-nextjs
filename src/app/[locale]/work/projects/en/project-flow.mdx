## 🧠 Overview

**Project Flow** is a full-featured, developer-first planning tool that bridges the gap between whiteboarding and implementation. Designed to help solo devs and teams visually map, organize, and architect software projects from idea to deployment.

Whether you're tracking frontend features, defining API endpoints, structuring databases, or visualizing system architecture with diagrams—Project Flow offers a unified interface for clear thinking and structured execution.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 📋 Feature-First Planning

Define and group project features with type, tags, and status chips. Visually break down functionality before implementation.

  alt="Feature Planning View"

### 🧩 Diagram Suite (Mermaid.js-powered)

Support for:

- Gantt timelines
- C4 architecture models
- Class diagrams
- Flowcharts

Edit diagrams with live preview, fullscreen mode, and **SVG/PNG export with bounding debug mode**.

### 🗃️ Database Schema Planning

Drag-and-drop schema designer with support for:

- Manual table/column entry
- File imports (SQL, Prisma)
- Relationship mapping
- Auto-generated ER diagrams

### 🧬 API Routes + OpenAPI Docs

Define project-level API endpoints with descriptions, parameters, and route types. View all endpoints in a Swagger-style interactive UI powered by RapiDoc.

## 🧱 Architecture & Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (Turbopack)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Design System**: ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (global planning state)
- **Auth**: NextAuth (Google, GitHub, Email/Password)
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js + custom export/preview pipeline
- **Docs UI**: rehype-pretty-code + MDX

---

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy

Project Flow was built as an internal dev utility first—meant to solve real pain points around:

- **Scope planning** before code
- Aligning **frontend + backend** development
- Having a **single source of truth** across routes, schema, and feature logic
- Empowering architecture thinking visually

---

## 📈 Development Highlights

- ✅ Visual Debug Export Mode (diagrams)
- ✅ Timeline/C4 support with live rendering
- ✅ Diagram export presets (SVG, HD, Print)
- ✅ State-coupled layout bounding
- ✅ Modular, navigable sidebar UI
- ✅ Full stack-type planning experience

---

## 🚧 WIP + Future Roadmap

- AI Planning Assistant Integration (Ororo-style contextual prompting)
- Workspace/multi-project support
- Real-time collab (WebSocket or Firestore layer)
- Multi-export view (PDF spec sheet generator)
- Context-aware diagram suggestions

---

## 🔗 Summary

Project Flow isn’t just a project tracker. It’s a **developer’s planning cockpit**—equipping you with the right tools to think, design, and execute complex applications without losing your train of thought.

💡 Built to be used **before the first line of code**.
